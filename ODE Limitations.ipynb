    "## Using the N-Body Method\n",
    "Having written an n-body right hand side function and bound the gravitational acceleration, lets try it out! You'll need to assemble the right hand side code into a file that can be imported. Move the ODE code you wrote into the same directory or create a package. Then experiment with the following algorithm/initial conditions.\n",

    "Begin by resurrecting your ODE code and doing some runs with initial conditions provided below' `euler`, `montgomery`, and `lagrange`. We know our best algorithm will be Euler-Richardson. \n",

    "Use Euler-Richardson integrate each of the initial conditions through 100 time units and plot the result. Adjust the time and find a point where the orbit stable through the entire time interval. Note cases that can not be completed without instabilities. Use the `time` module and function to determine the time required. Record the times and step requirements for future reference. Also, make an accounting of how many function calls occur.\n",

    "After successful implementation of the RK45 algorithm, answer the following question.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a complete run (100 time units) for each of the initial conditions provided below. Determine the `abs` and `rtol` values needed to get stable orbits on this time scale. Note cases that can not be completed without instabilities. Use the `time` module and function to determine the time required. Record the times and time step requirements for future reference. Create a table that has each of the three algorithms (`EulerRichardson`, `RK4`, `RK45`) as rows, and in the columns record the maximum `dt` or `atol` and`rtol`, the number of function calls, and the time required for execution. Write a brief statement about which of the algorithms you believe is best, and why.\n",
    "2. For fun, complete all the initial conditions at the end of the page and include plots of their orbits. \n",
    "3. Examine the stability of the solutions to the three-body problem (`euler`,`mongomery`,`lagrange`,`skinny_pineapple`, `hand_in_oval`) by slightly varying the initial velocity of one of the masses. Before passing your new initial state to the ODE solver, calculate the center of mass velocity and subtract this velocity from every object. Is the instability an inherit physical property, or the result of the ODE solver? Make a clear statement about which initial conditions are stable or unstable. Compute and monitor the conservation of the total energy (that is potential plus kinetic). Total energy can be computed from the ODE output and plotted - this will be discussed Thursday 3/25/21."
